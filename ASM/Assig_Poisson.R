# About Dataset
# The New York City Department of Transportation collects daily data about the 
# number of bicycles going over bridges in New York City. This data is used to 
# measure bike utilization as a part of transportation planning. This dataset 
# is a daily record of the number of bicycles crossing into or out of Manhattan 
# via one of the East River bridges (that is, excluding Bronx thruways and the 
# non-bikeable Hudson River tunnels) for 9 months.
#
# Content
# A count of the number of bicycles on each of the bridges in question is provided 
# on a day-by-day basis, along with information on maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation.
#
# Research Questions 
# In this dataset, how many bicycles cross into and out of Manhattan per day?
# How strongly do weather conditions affect bike volumes?
# What is the top bridge in terms of bike load?
